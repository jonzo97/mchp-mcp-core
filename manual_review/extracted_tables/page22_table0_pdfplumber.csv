2.5.,Debugging or Progra,mming Pins,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,"The SWDIO, SWO, SWCLK",pins are used fo,r In-Circu,it programmi,ng and deb,ugging,purposes. It,
,is recommended to keep,the trace length,between,the debug ex,ternal conn,ector a,nd the debug,
,pins on the device as sho,rt as possible to,minimize,ESD/EMI vuln,erabilities.,If the d,ebug externa,l
,connector is expected to,experience an E,"SD event,",a series resist,or is recom,mende,"d, with the va",lue
,in the range of a few tens,"of Ohms, not to",exceed 1,00 Ohms with,protection,using,Transient Vol,tage
,"Suppressors (TVS), at the",user’s discretion,. Refer to,the Schemati,c Checklist,chapte,r.,
,,,,,,,,
2.6.,JTAG,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,"The TMS, TDO, TDI and T",CK pins are used,for testin,g and debugg,ing accordi,ng to t,he Joint Test,
,Action Group (JTAG) stan,dard. It is recom,mended t,o keep the tra,ce length b,etween,the JTAG,
,connector and the JTAG p,ins on the devic,e as short,as possible. I,f the JTAG c,onnect,or is expecte,d to
,"experience an ESD event,",a series resistor,is recom,"mended, with",the value i,n the r,ange of a few,tens
,"of Ohms, not to exceed 1",00 Ohms with pr,otection,using Transie,nt Voltage S,uppres,"sors (TVS), at",the
,user’s discretion. Refer to,the Schematic C,hecklist c,hapter.,,,,
,,,,,,,,
2.7.,Trace,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,When present on select p,"in counts, the tr",ace pins c,an be connec,ted to a ha,rdware,trace-enable,d
,programmer/debugger t,o provide a comp,ressed re,al-time instru,ction trace.,When,used for trac,"e,"
,"the TRACE_DATA0, TRACE","_DATA1, TRACE_","DATA2, T",RACE_DATA3,and TRACE,CLK pin,s should be,
,dedicated for this use. Th,e trace hardwar,e requires,a 22 Ohm se,ries resisto,r betwe,en the trace,
,pins and the external trac,e connector.,,,,,,

2.8.,External Oscillator P,ins,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,Many MCUs have options,for at least two,oscillator,s: a high-freq,uency prim,ary osci,llator and a,
,low-frequency secondary,oscillator.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,The oscillator circuit shou,ld be placed on,the same,side of the bo,ard as the,device.,"Also, place",
,the oscillator circuit close,to the respectiv,e oscillato,"r pins, not ex",ceeding on,e-half i,nch (12 mm),
,distance between them.,The load capacito,rs should,be placed ne,xt to the os,cillator,"itself, on the",
,same side of the board. U,se a grounded c,opper po,ur around the,oscillator,circuit t,o isolate them,
,from surrounding circuits,. The grounded,copper po,ur should be,routed dire,ctly to,the MCU gro,und.
,Do not run any signal tra,ces or power tra,ces inside,the ground p,"our. Also, if",using,a two-sided,
,"board, avoid any traces o",n the other side,of the bo,ard where the,crystal is p,laced.,A suggested,
,layout is illustrated in the,following figure,.,,,,,
