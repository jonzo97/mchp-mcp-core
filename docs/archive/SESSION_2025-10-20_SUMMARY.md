# Session Summary - 2025-10-20

## Context: Table Extraction Quality - Extractor Harmony Analysis

This session continued work on PDF table extraction quality for Microchip datasheets, focusing on understanding and improving agreement between three extractors (pdfplumber, Camelot, PyMuPDF).

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Camelot Tuning (COMPLETE)
**Problem**: Camelot missing ~19 rows (26%) on pinout tables vs other extractors
**Solution**: Switched from lattice mode to stream mode
**Result**: 40% improvement (55 → 77 rows captured)

**Key Files**:
- `mchp_mcp_core/extractors/table_extractors.py:507` - Changed default mode to "stream"
- `tests/tune_camelot.py` - Tested 15 configurations (9 lattice + 6 stream)
- `docs/CAMELOT_TUNING.md` - Detailed analysis

**Finding**: Mode selection matters more than parameter tuning. Stream mode (text-based) outperforms lattice mode (line-based) on Microchip datasheets.

### 2. ✅ Multi-Page Detection Verified (COMPLETE)
**Test**: Real pinout tables on pages 30-32 (real pages 31-33)
**Result**: Successfully merged 114 rows across 3 pages
**Confidence**: 0.88 continuation, 0.87 final merged table

### 3. ✅ Extractor Harmony Testing (COMPLETE)
**Tested 5 different table types**:
- Page 25: Simple table (8x5) - **PERFECT harmony** ✅
- Page 55: Large pinout (34-41 rows) - Structural disagreement
- Page 65: Multiple tables - Mixed quality
- Page 70: Medium table (5-14 rows) - Boundary disagreement
- Page 5: Large complex (47-89 rows) - Major disagreement

**Key Files**:
- `tests/find_tables.py` - Scans PDFs for all tables (found 18 in first 100 pages)
- `tests/test_extractor_harmony.py` - Systematic harmony testing
- `docs/EXTRACTOR_HARMONY_ANALYSIS.md` - Full analysis
- `manual_review/screenshots/` - Visual verification generated

**Results**:
- Simple tables: 100% harmony
- Complex tables: Structural differences but often high data accuracy
- 83% high-confidence extraction rate (confidence > 0.80)

## Critical Issue Identified (ACTIVE)

### Header/Data Accuracy Metrics Not Working as Designed

**User's Question**: "What happened to tracking the data and the table size/header formatting separately?"

**Current State**:
- Metrics ARE calculated (header_accuracy, data_row_accuracy)
- Weighted 30% header / 70% data in confidence score
- BUT: Assumes extractors have same number of header rows

**The Real Problem** (Page 55 example):
```
pdfplumber: 34 total rows
  - 2 header rows (clean)
  - 32 data rows (PA0-PA31)

Camelot: 41 total rows
  - 7 "header" rows (includes column indices, table title, fragmented headers)
  - 32 data rows (PA0-PA31) - IDENTICAL to pdfplumber!
  - 2 extra rows at end

Current metrics report:
  Header accuracy: 0.35 (wrong - comparing 7 vs 2 rows)
  Data row accuracy: 0.48 (wrong - misaligned due to header count assumption)

REALITY: 32 data rows are IDENTICAL (should be 100% data accuracy)
```

**Root Cause**: Algorithm assumes:
1. ✅ Extractors capture the same table
2. ✅ With different header formatting

But actually:
1. ❌ Extractors capture different boundaries (Camelot includes table title, etc.)
2. ❌ Different numbers of header rows (7 vs 2)
3. ✅ Data rows ARE identical when properly aligned

## Files Created This Session

### Documentation
- `docs/CAMELOT_TUNING.md` - Parameter tuning results
- `docs/EXTRACTOR_HARMONY_ANALYSIS.md` - Harmony testing analysis
- `docs/SESSION_2025-10-20_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Test Scripts
- `tests/tune_camelot.py` - Camelot configuration testing
- `tests/find_tables.py` - PDF scanning for table discovery
- `tests/test_extractor_harmony.py` - Systematic harmony testing
- `tests/check_page55_harmony.py` - Deep dive into page 55 metrics

### Data
- `manual_review/screenshots/` - PNG screenshots for pages 5, 25, 55, 65, 70
- `manual_review/extracted_tables/` - CSV exports for comparison

## Next Steps (TODO)

### Immediate: Fix Header/Data Accuracy Metrics
The user identified that the current metrics aren't properly separating header formatting from data accuracy.

**Proposed Solution**:
1. Detect header rows **per extractor** (variable-length headers)
2. Implement content-based row alignment (match PA0 to PA0, not row[5] to row[5])
3. Compare only overlapping data rows
4. Report separately:
   - Data row accuracy: % of aligned data rows that match
   - Header handling: Structural differences (7 rows vs 2 rows)
   - Boundary detection: What each extractor included/excluded

**Expected Outcome for Page 55**:
```
Data row accuracy: 100% (32/32 rows PA0-PA31 match perfectly)
Header rows: 7 (Camelot) vs 2 (pdfplumber) - formatting difference
Boundary: Camelot includes table title + column indices
```

### Pending Work (from TodoList)
- Phase 3B: Manual verification UI
- Phase 3C: Benchmarking on 1000+ tables
- Serena MCP setup for context management
- Archive outdated docs

## Technical Context

### Current Extractors
- **pdfplumber**: Conservative, clean headers, reliable
- **Camelot (stream mode)**: Captures more context, sometimes includes extra rows
- **PyMuPDF**: Aligns with pdfplumber, sometimes fails on complex tables

### Confidence Scoring Formula
```
confidence = (
    0.4 * agreement_score +      # How many extractors found table
    0.3 * structure_score +      # Row/column consistency
    0.3 * cell_similarity        # Currently: 0.3 * header + 0.7 * data
)
```

### Key Code Locations
- `mchp_mcp_core/extractors/table_extractors.py:507` - CamelotExtractor (stream mode)
- `mchp_mcp_core/extractors/table_consensus.py:XXX` - Header/data accuracy calculation
  - `_compute_header_data_accuracy()` - Needs fixing
  - `_estimate_header_rows()` - Too simplistic
  - `_compare_table_rows()` - Assumes aligned rows

## Session Stats
- Token usage: ~87K / 200K (43%)
- Files modified: 10+
- Tests run: 15 Camelot configs, 5 harmony tests
- Tables analyzed: 18 found in first 100 pages

## User's Current Request
"Let's compact right now" - User wants to pause and continue in fresh session due to the header/data accuracy issue that needs deeper refactoring.

## Recommended Continuation

1. **Read this summary**
2. **Fix the header/data accuracy algorithm**:
   - Implement per-extractor header detection
   - Add content-based row alignment (not index-based)
   - Separate boundary differences from content differences
3. **Re-test on pages 25, 55, 70**
4. **Update EXTRACTOR_HARMONY_ANALYSIS.md** with corrected metrics
